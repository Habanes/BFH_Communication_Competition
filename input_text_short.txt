The sun rises in the east. The moon sets in the west. The water in the river flows quickly. A tall tree stands in the garden. The small bird sings a sweet song. White clouds float in the blue sky. The red car drives down the street. A yellow bus stops at the corner. The green grass needs to be cut. Fresh flowers smell very nice. The old dog barks at the mailman. A black cat crosses the road. The hot coffee burns my tongue. Cold ice cream melts fast. The big book is heavy to carry. A sharp pencil writes well. The wooden table is very strong. Soft pillows make sleep better. The bright light hurts my eyes. Dark night brings the stars. The loud music plays all night. The quiet library is peaceful. A fast runner wins the race. The slow turtle walks along. The happy child laughs loud. The sad movie made me cry. A strong wind blows the leaves. The gentle rain falls softly. The deep ocean is full of fish. The high mountain is hard to climb. A purple flower grows wild. The orange sunset is beautiful. The gray elephant is huge. A pink dress looks pretty. The brown bear sleeps in a cave. The white snow covers the ground. A gold ring shines bright. The silver coin is valuable. The clear glass holds water. A metal key opens the door. The tasty pizza has cheese. A sweet apple is a healthy snack. The sour lemon makes faces pucker. Hot soup warms the body. Cold water is refreshing. The spicy pepper burns the mouth. Fresh bread smells good. A ripe banana is yellow. The juicy orange is sweet. Green grapes are delicious. The smart student reads books. A kind teacher helps the class. The busy worker types fast. A brave firefighter saves lives. The skilled doctor heals the sick. A nice neighbor says hello. The friendly shopkeeper sells fruit. A talented artist paints pictures. The loud singer performs on stage. A quiet writer types stories. The modern phone is useful. A vintage clock ticks loudly. The new computer is fast. An old radio plays songs. The clean room looks nice. A messy desk needs cleaning. The open window lets in air. A closed door keeps it quiet. The soft blanket is warm. A hard chair is uncomfortable. The long road goes on forever. A short path leads home. The wide river is hard to cross. A narrow street is crowded. The heavy box is full. A light feather floats down. The wet towel needs drying. A dry desert is hot. The smooth stone feels cool. A rough wall scratches skin. The early bird catches the worm. A late arrival misses the show. The rich man buys a car. A poor boy needs help. The young girl plays with dolls. An old man walks with a cane. The safe place is here. A dangerous cliff is near. The true story is interesting. A false rumor spreads fast. The simple answer is best. A complex problem takes time. The first step is the hardest. The last day is sad. A good friend is loyal. The bad weather stays away. The right way is forward. A left turn leads back. The top shelf is high. The bottom drawer is stuck.
